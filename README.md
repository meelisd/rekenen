Web UI for simple math practice

Single page app, with 3 'modes':
1. Simple UI for picking multiplication tables to practice, or division with optional remainders
2. Somewhat gamified practice mode (the student is done when the HP of the program reaches 0)
3. Stats, shown at the end that gives some insight into the quality of the practice

The student gets practice sums, and incorrect answers lead to that sum being repeated.

# Problems

Intl.DateTimeFormat not supported in Safari which makes the timer display not work.

Counting the number of correct answers in a row fails the first time in Safari.

# Improvements

* More types of sums (fractions, splitting more complex multiplications)
* Bonus points for 'correctness-streak'
* Choosing between timed practice and points targets.
